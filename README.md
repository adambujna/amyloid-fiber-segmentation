# Automated Segmentation of Amyloid Fibres from Electron Micrographs

This repository contains the code, data, and resources associated with my bachelor's thesis project, which explores the use of deep learning models for the segmentation and quantification of amyloid fibres in negative stain electron microscopy images. The work addresses challenges such as fibre clustering, overlap, and limited annotated data through the generation of synthetic datasets and model evaluation under controlled conditions.
